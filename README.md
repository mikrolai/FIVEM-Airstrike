# FIVEM-Airstrike
Airstrike script for FIVEM


Add "AIStrikesV" to your resources and add it in the server.cfg too.

To launch the Airstrike without any Item just add "Mikrolai_airstrike" to your resources and server.cfg too.
If u done that you're able to set a Waypoint on the Map and launch a Airstrike by pressing "Shift + arrowdown"

If u want to have an Item that people can buy and use to do Airstrikes do the following:

1. insert the item.sql to your Database.

2. add this Item ("airstrike") to any Shop you want for the price you want.

3. add "airstrike_item" to your resources and server.cfg too.

After that you should be able to buy the Airstrike item and use it.


If you want to have both (Shortcut and Item) just insert both scripst.


This should be everything you need. Let me know if it's working because this here is my first reworked script / Tutorial.
Big Credits going out to IceHax!! (original Post: https://forum.cfx.re/t/aistrikesv-ai-driven-airstrikes/109649)

Big thanks to AndrewChengP too!
He tested it alot and with him I was able to make it work without to mess around in the esx_basicneeds/esx_extraitems config.

If the Script doesn't work try to wipe your Server cache and try to start the "airstrike_item" Resource at last.

Have Fun!
